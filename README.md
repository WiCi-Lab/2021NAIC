Competition Background

5G+AI has become the most popular research area for the development of wireless communications. Competition becomes an unprecedented way to promote the integration of 5G and AI by involving academic and industrial R&D to solve typical wireless problems with AI/ML tools.

The 5G+AI Work Group of IMT-2020 (5G) Promotion Group is committed to conduct research on the requirements, theories and technologies of deep integration of 5G and AI, and promote the international standardization and industrialization process of 5G and AI integration. Wireless Communication AI Competition (WAIC) is hosted by The 5G+AI Work Group of IMT-2020 (5G) Promotion Group for researchers to contribute on the integration of wireless communications and AI, with the theme of AI Enlightens Wireless Communication. A continue influence is expected for the WAIC to attract academic and industry contribution to the integration of 5G and AI.
